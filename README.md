# Community Presentation Contest 2023 Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology
- This is a community project aimed at encouraging people to dispose of waste, especially electronic waste, in the proper place.
An Arduino board will be connected to a computer via the serial port and will simultaneously display a video related to a growing
tree. Each time waste is placed in the bin and passes through the infrared sensor, the computer will play a short segment of the
video to convey the message that disposing of waste helps the tree grow.
